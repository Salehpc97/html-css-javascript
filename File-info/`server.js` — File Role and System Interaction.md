### `server.js` â€” File Role and System Interaction

#### File Role

Acts as the main entry point for the backend server. It initializes the Express application, configures essential middleware (CORS and JSON parsing), defines the root endpoint, and starts the server on port 3000.


#### System Interaction

- **Integration:**
    - Receives all incoming HTTP requests to the backend.
    - Routes requests to appropriate handlers or future modules.
    - Provides a health check endpoint (`/`) for system monitoring or connectivity tests.
    - Prepares the backend to interact with front-end clients or external services via RESTful APIs.
